# Mechanical Centrifugal System Simulation

Simulation of a 3rd order control system 

## Abstract

The dynamical equation and the state equation of mechanical centrifugal governor system are derived through Lagrange equations. 
The system of periodic motion is analyzed by using the phase portrait, the time course diagram and the Poincar√© map of the system. 
The chaos anti-control method by addition of linear feedback is dissertated and analyzed numerically by numerical methods. 
Numerical simulation shows the effectiveness and feasibility of the chaos anti-control strategy for controlling the related 
stable periodic orbit of the non-autonomous system to chaotic orbit.
